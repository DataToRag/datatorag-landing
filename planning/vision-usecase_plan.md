## Discovery Approach

### Business Outcome Discovery

I'll ask strategic questions across these areas:

1. **Strategic Context** - Business drivers, positioning, target users, success definition
2. **Solution Space** - Solution type, AI strategy, competitive advantages, constraints
3. **Value Proposition** - User outcomes, success metrics, game-changers, stakeholders

### Visioning Exercise

I'll facilitate a forward-looking exercise:

1. **Future State** - "Imagine 12 months from now..."
2. **Transformation** - What changed? Who benefited?
3. **Core Value** - What makes this transformative?
4. **Success Factors** - What must be true?

### Vision Statement Output

The final vision statement will capture:

- Problem being solved (and for whom)
- Transformation being created
- Value being delivered
- Success criteria and expected impact

## Notes

- Build on technical discovery already completed
- Focus on business outcomes, not technical implementation
- Use [Question]/[Answer] format for clarity
- Create compelling narrative for stakeholders
