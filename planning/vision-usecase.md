## Strategic Context Discovery

### Business Challenge / Opportunity

**[Question]** What business challenge or opportunity is driving the DatatoRAG initiative?

**[Answer]**
Multiple converging market opportunities:

1. **HR Information Crisis:** Employees lose ~1.8 hours/day searching for HR documents across siloed systems (Salesforce, Workday, SharePoint, Slack)
2. **Onboarding Failure:** Only 12% of employees rate onboarding as "great," leading to 1 in 3 new hires quitting within 90 days
3. **Remote Work Challenges:** 63% of remote hires feel undertrained, 60% feel disoriented
4. **Compliance Complexity:** Increasing burden from pay transparency laws, AI regulations, multi-state compliance rules
5. **AI Opportunity Gap:** Companies want to leverage AI but lack in-house ML/AI teams to build solutions

**Market Timing:** Executive mandates to "do something with AI" combined with distributed workforce expansion creating urgent demand for plug-and-play AI solutions.
