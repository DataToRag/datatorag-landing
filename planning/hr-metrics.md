For HR specifically,
Company Attributes
• Size: 500–5,000 employees
• Industries: Tech-enabled services, B2B SaaS, insurance, telecom
• Stack: Salesforce, Workday, SharePoint, Slack
• No in-house ML/AI team
• Exclude: <100 staff, AI-heavy orgs, heavily regulated gov/finance
Buyer Personas
• HR / People Ops Directors → compliance, onboarding, policy knowledge
• HR Ops Managers / HRIS Admins → system + docs management
• CHROs / CPOs → engagement, compliance risk, culture
Key Pain Points
• Info silos: Employees lose ~1.8 hrs/day searching for docs
• Onboarding gaps: Only 12% rate onboarding “great” → 1 in 3 quits in 90 days
• Remote hires: 63% feel undertrained, 60% disoriented
• Compliance sprawl: Pay transparency, AI regs, multi-state rules
• Manual workflows: 29% of HR leaders say paperwork frustrates new hires
Buying Triggers
• Big onboarding push / hiring wave
• New compliance mandates (e.g. pay transparency, AI)
• Rising HR ticket volume
• Exec mandate to “do something with AI”
• Distributed workforce expansion
Value Prop
• Central AI knowledgebase → self-serve answers, less wasted search
• Faster, consistent onboarding → lower early attrition
• Compliance guardrails → auto updates across states/regs
• No AI team needed → plug-and-play RAG stack
• Free HR to focus on engagement + strategy
