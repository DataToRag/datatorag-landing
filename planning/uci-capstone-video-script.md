# FULL SCRIPT (copy this for teleprompter)

Hi, I'm Manuel Yang, and I'm Minda Wang. We're the cofounders of DataToRag.

We help organizations turn scattered internal knowledge into searchable, AI-powered insights - without needing an in-house AI team.

Here's the problem we solve: Organizations are drowning in unstructured data - policies in SharePoint, docs in Google Drive, updates buried in email. Critical knowledge is trapped in silos that don't talk to each other.

The impact? Employees lose 1.8 hours every day just searching for information. Only 12% rate their onboarding as "great." And one in three new hires quits within 90 days.

For this project, you'll build an AI-powered knowledgebase using real UCI data - course catalogs, job opportunities, campus resources, and HR policies. Think of it as a specialized layer that could complement tools like ZotGPT, but focused on making institutional knowledge instantly searchable and accessible.

Both of us will mentor your team through the full AI development lifecycle - from data ingestion to deployment. Expect weekly check-ins and async support via Slack and Notion.

You'll gain hands-on experience building a complete RAG system - the architecture behind modern AI assistants. You'll work with real institutional data, experience the full AI development lifecycle, and connect AI to actual workflows. This is production-ready work, not a toy project.

We're looking for students who are curious, collaborative, and excited to ship real AI products. If you want to build something that makes information more accessible - join us.
