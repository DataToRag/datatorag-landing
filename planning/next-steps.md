## Immediate Next Steps (Before Sprint 1)

### 1. Answer Critical Questions ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKING**

These questions must be answered before starting development:

**a) AWS Setup**

- [ ] Do you have an existing AWS account, or need to create a new one?
- [ ] What AWS region(s) should we deploy to? (recommend: us-east-1 or us-west-2)
- [ ] What is your AWS cost budget for MVP? (estimated: $850-1,150/month)

**b) Development Tools**

- [ ] What SCM platform? (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- [ ] What CI/CD platform? (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)
- [ ] Python dependency management? (recommend: poetry for better dependency resolution)

**c) Team & Process**

- [ ] What Jira plan? (Jira Cloud recommended for ease of use)
- [ ] Sprint length? (recommend: 2 weeks)
- [ ] Team size and structure?
- [ ] Team skill levels with AWS, Python, ML/embeddings?

---

### 2. Pre-MVP Setup Tasks

Once critical questions are answered, complete these setup tasks:

#### AWS Account Setup (1-2 days)

- [ ] Create or configure AWS account
- [ ] Set up billing alarms (recommend: $1000/month threshold)
- [ ] Create IAM admin user for deployments (with MFA)
- [ ] Request service quota increases if needed:
  - [ ] SageMaker endpoint instances (ml.g5.xlarge)
  - [ ] OpenSearch domain (r6g.large instances)
  - [ ] VPC Elastic IPs (for NAT Gateway)
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
- [ ] Enable AWS Config for compliance tracking

#### Repository Setup (1 day)

- [ ] Create repository: `datatorag-mvp`
- [ ] Initialize with project structure from MVP plan
- [ ] Set up branch protection on `main`:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Prevent force pushes
- [ ] Configure `.gitignore` for Python
- [ ] Add README with project overview
- [ ] Set up GitHub/GitLab secrets for CI/CD:
  - AWS credentials (or use OIDC)
  - AWS region
  - AWS account ID

#### CI/CD Pipeline Setup (1 day)

- [ ] Create CI/CD workflow for CloudFormation deployments
- [ ] Set up environments (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Configure deployment approvals for production
- [ ] Test pipeline with a simple "hello world" stack

#### Jira Project Setup (0.5 day)

- [ ] Create Jira project: `DATATORAG`
- [ ] Import epics and stories (use [jira-import.csv](jira-import.csv))
- [ ] Set up sprint board
- [ ] Configure workflow (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Code Review ‚Üí Done)
- [ ] Link Jira to repository (for commit tracking)
- [ ] Create first sprint (Sprint 1: Infrastructure Foundation)

#### Team Onboarding (1 day)

- [ ] Share architecture documentation with team
- [ ] Review MVP implementation plan
- [ ] Assign roles and responsibilities
- [ ] Set up team communication channels
- [ ] Schedule sprint ceremonies:
  - Sprint planning (beginning of sprint)
  - Daily standups (15 min)
  - Sprint review/demo (end of sprint)
  - Sprint retrospective (end of sprint)

### 3. Gemma Model Validation (CRITICAL - Week 1)

**Before starting Sprint 2**, validate the embedding model:

- [ ] Research `google/gemma-2-300m` on HuggingFace
- [ ] Test model locally:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
  model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-300m")
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-300m")
  # Test embedding generation
  ```
- [ ] Verify embedding output dimension (should be 768)
- [ ] Test embedding quality on sample HR text
- [ ] Confirm SageMaker compatibility (HuggingFace DLC support)
- [ ] **Decision:** Use Gemma OR fallback to `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

**Fallback Option:**
If Gemma is not suitable, use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`:

- Dimension: 384 (change OpenSearch index config)
- Well-tested for semantic search
- Easy SageMaker deployment

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Gemma model compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Validate in Week 1, have fallback (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
2. **OpenSearch performance**
   - Mitigation: Benchmark early, tune k-NN parameters
3. **PDF parsing quality**
   - Mitigation: Test with diverse samples, add Textract if needed
4. **SageMaker cold starts**
   - Mitigation: Keep endpoint warm with scheduled pings

### Operational Risks

1. **Cost overruns**
   - Mitigation: Set CloudWatch billing alarms, monitor daily
2. **Security compliance**
   - Mitigation: Security audit in Sprint 5, encrypt everything
3. **Scaling bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Design for horizontal scaling, use SQS buffering
